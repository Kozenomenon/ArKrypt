# ArKrypt - API Examples
Included are two API examples. The mod uses both of them, but you don't need them both. I implemented the same thing in python and nodejs. 

Also, included here is a [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) export if you would like to test the API routes manually without the ADK/Mod. 

To use it open Postman and go to `File` -> `Import`.  
Then select the included json: `ArKrypt.postman_collection.json`  

It will create a collect "ArKrypt" with 8 test routes, 4 for each of the two API examples.  

`http://localhost:5555/` - this is the NodeJS example   
`http://127.0.0.1:8000/` - this is the Python example  
_You can of course change ports however you like..._
