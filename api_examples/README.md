# ArKrypt - API Examples
Included are three API examples. The mod uses all of them, but you don't need to use them all. 
- [Python Example](/api_examples/py)
- [NodeJS Example](/api_examples/node)
- [PHP Example](/api_examples/php)

Also, included here is a [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) export if you would like to test the API routes manually without the ADK/Mod. 

To use it open Postman and go to `File` -> `Import`.  
Then select the included json: `ArKrypt.postman_collection.json`  

It will create a collect "ArKrypt" with 12 test routes, 4 for each of the two API examples.  

`http://localhost:5555/` - this is the NodeJS example   
`http://127.0.0.1:8000/` - this is the Python example  
`http://localhost:8181/` - this is the PHP example  
_You can of course change ports however you like..._
